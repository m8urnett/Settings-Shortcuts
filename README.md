# Shortcuts
A collection of shortcuts for all Windows shell and settings functions so they may be indexed through other applications. Launcher tools such as Hain, Wox, and Launchy don't index many of the Windows settings so you can place all of these links in a location where they can be indexed and easily-launched. 

Instructions: clone or download the repository to a place, have your launcher look at that place for stuff. 

Here's an example of how it looks in Hain:
